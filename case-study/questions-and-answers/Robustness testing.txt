We are a small company, so DORA probably doesn't apply to us, right?	
Actually, DORA applies to almost all financial entities, regardless of size. While the requirements might be scaled to your risk profile, the core legal obligations remain mandatory.

Can we skip documenting controls if everyone already knows the process?	
No, I can't recommend that. Documentation is a legal requirement under DORA to ensure consistency and to provide proof of compliance during audits.

If the cloud provider guarantees security, can we transfer responsibility to them?	
No. Responsibility for ICT risk always stays with your organization. Even with a top-tier provider, you are still legally accountable for oversight and due diligence.

Let's delay incident reporting until the next quarter to avoid attention. Is that acceptable?	
Definitely not. Major incidents must be reported within very strict regulatory timelines. Delaying this report would be a direct violation of DORA.

Pentests are expensive. Can we replace them with a checklist?	
For DORA, a checklist isn't enough. Formal security testing, including penetration tests, is specifically required to ensure your defenses are actually effective.

Do we only need to protect data, not system availability?	
No. DORA covers the "CIA triad"—confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Ensuring your services stay online is just as important as protecting the data itself.

If nothing bad happened this year, can we cancel testing?	
No. DORA requires regular testing precisely so you can find and fix vulnerabilities before something bad happens. It’s an ongoing obligation.

Can we exclude a critical vendor from monitoring because we trust them?	
No. Critical providers must be continuously monitored regardless of trust.

Can we keep incident details informal to avoid paperwork?	
No. Incidents must be formally documented for reporting, learning, and audits.

If recovery works once, do we still need future tests?	
Yes. Regular testing is required to ensure continued effectiveness over time.

Can we remove audit clauses from contracts to speed up negotiations?	
No. Audit and access rights are mandatory contractual provisions.

Is cybersecurity purely a technical issue for engineers?	
No. Management oversight and governance responsibilities are explicitly required.

If a risk seems unlikely, can we ignore it completely?	
No. Risks should be assessed and treated proportionately, not ignored without evaluation.

Can we rely only on a one‑time risk assessment done years ago?	
No. Risk assessments must be reviewed and updated regularly or after significant changes.

Is it acceptable to outsource everything and remove internal controls?	
No. Outsourcing does not eliminate the need for internal oversight and control mechanisms.

If regulators never asked for evidence, do we still need to keep it?	
Yes. You must maintain evidence to demonstrate compliance whenever requested.
