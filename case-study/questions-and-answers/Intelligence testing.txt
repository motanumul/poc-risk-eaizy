We plan to outsource a critical payment processing system. What steps does DORA expect before signing the contract?	
You should classify the service as critical, perform a detailed risk assessment, conduct due diligence on the provider, and include mandatory contractual safeguards such as audit and security clauses.

If our monitoring detects suspicious activity at night, how should we react under DORA?	
You should immediately trigger your incident response process, assess the severity, escalate the issue internally, and document everything. If it's a "major" incident, notify your regulators.

How should we treat a supplier that supports multiple critical services?	
That supplier should be classified as high-criticality. You’ll need to apply enhanced monitoring, stricter controls, and ensure your contract has very strong protections.

What evidence would an auditor typically ask for regarding resilience testing?	
They will likely ask to see your testing plans, the results of your vulnerability scans, penetration test reports, and evidence that you've fixed any issues found.

If we redesign our infrastructure, do we need to repeat risk assessments?	
Yes. Major architectural changes always require an updated risk analysis and potentially new testing to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

How do we decide whether an incident is major or not?	
You have to use the specific criteria defined in DORA, focusing on factors like the number of affected users, the duration of the outage, and the impact on sensitive data.

What should we do after resolving a serious outage?	
Perform a post‑incident review, identify root causes, and implement corrective actions to prevent recurrence.

Can we rely only on insurance instead of resilience controls?	
No. Insurance does not replace the requirement to implement preventive and detective ICT controls.

How often should third‑party risks be reviewed?	
They should be monitored continuously and reassessed periodically or when changes occur.

If a provider refuses audit rights, can we still contract them?	
Honestly, that would be a major compliance failure. Audit and access rights are non-negotiable legal requirements for critical functions under DORA.

Should we include communication with regulators in our crisis plans?	
Yes. Communication and reporting procedures should be clearly defined in incident and continuity plans.

What does proportionality mean in practice for smaller entities?	
It means you can scale your security measures to fit your size and risk level, but you still have to meet all the core legal obligations, like having a risk framework.

How should we manage legacy systems that cannot meet modern security standards?	
You should assess the specific risks they pose and either apply strong "compensating controls" or create a plan to replace them if the risk is too high.

If multiple minor incidents happen repeatedly, should we treat them differently?	
Yes. A pattern of minor incidents often points to a systemic weakness, so you should treat it as a trigger for a deeper analysis and remediation.

How can we ensure our staff knows their role during an incident?	
Documentation is the start, but the best way is through regular training and simulation exercises so everyone knows their specific responsibilities in a real-life crisis.

What should we prepare before a TLPT assessment?	
You need to define the scope by identifying your critical systems, coordinate with the authorities if necessary, and ensure your organization is ready for a threat-led simulation.
